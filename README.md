## Overview

For this assignment, you'll create a budget tracker with React. This assignment will require you to break up your application's UI into components, manage component state, and respond to user events.

## User Story

* As a user, I want to be able to view all my expenses so that I have access to them and can see the total of my entered expenses.

## Business Context

An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.

## Acceptance Criteria

The application should render on a single page:

  * A form to input an expense.

  * A table of all expenses.

  * A running total of entered expenses.
  
A user should be able to input an expense, consisting of: 

  * A dollar amount
